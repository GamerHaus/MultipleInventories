This command imports data from another inventory-
management plugin.

Currently, only MultiInv is supported, but other plugins
could be added by request (open an issue on GitHub).

The migration can be very long, depending on how many
unique player you have on your server. For 20k players,
three to four hours were needed.

While importing, the players will be locked out of the
server, as online players may interfere with the process.
They will be able to check out the migration progress and
ETA by trying to login onto the server: the kick message
will display these data.

You'll be ask to confirm your choice before the migration
starts, except if you append §6--confirm§r to the command.
