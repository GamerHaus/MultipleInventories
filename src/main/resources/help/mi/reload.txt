Hot-reloads the configuration from the disk, and applies
it immediately without server reload or restart.

§9§lNew worlds on the server

When you create a world on the server, as example using
MultiWorld, it is automatically added to the §odefault§r
group without further action. You only need to run this
command if you want it to be on another group, after you
updated the configuration file to match.

§9§lAbout existing players on configuration change

Please note that if you change the worlds group or the
inventories-per-gamemode option, the plugin will use the
current inventories of the players for their current
world and gamemode.

As example, let's say that you had two worlds, §7world_1§r
and §7world_2§r, on the same group, with players on both
worlds, and you change the configuration to have them on
distinct groups; the players on the §7world_2§r will have
their current inventory for this world and an empty one for
§7world_1§r, and §ovice-versa§r for the players in the
§7world_1§r. To avoid that, ensure that all players are
in the correct world before reloading the configuration.

The same applies if you change the inventories-per-gamemode
option.

§9§lConfiguration update from the game

A command to update the world groups from in-game without
updating manually the configuration file is currently not
available and not planned. Open an issue on GitHub if you
need such a feature.
